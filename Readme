Kubernetes expects that all the images are pre-built
We require one config file / object
We manually need to setup all networking concept

we need to create a separate folder out of the project4 directory and name something, in my case its simplek8s

what is an object?
Object types?
    Statefulset
    ReplicaContainer
    Pod
    Service
difference between service and pod
